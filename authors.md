# Information for Authors

<!-- **SSDBM 2020 will be an online event.** -->
<!-- All talks will be delivered in the form of pre-recorded videos. The Q&A parts will be held as online chat. -->


## Topics of Interest
SSDBM 2021 will have a focus on Database System Support of AI/Machine Learning/Data Mining. The conference encourages authors to make their experimental results reproducible and include reproducibility experiences in their submissions .

Topics of particular interest include, but are not limited to, the following, as they relate to scientific and statistical data management:

 - Mining and analysis of large-scale databases, especially on new and emerging hardware and environments
 - Data flow management in high performance computing
 - Techniques for comparing simulation and experimental data
 - Cloud computing issues in large-scale data management
 - Design, implementation, optimization, and reproducibility of scientific workflows
 - Integration and exchange of data, including the federation and management of institutional data repositories
 - Visualization and exploration of large datasets
 - Information retrieval and text mining
 - Knowledge discovery, clustering, graph analysis
 - Case studies, particularly those at scale-of-consequence for genomics, astrophysics, and high-energy physics
 - Stream data management, e.g., storage, organization, compression, indexing and querying
 - Stream data analysis, e.g., summarization, statistical analysis, pattern matching, pattern discovery, learning, and prediction
 - Modeling and representation of streaming data
