# Information for Authors

**SSDBM 2020 will be an online event.**
All talks will be delivered in the form of pre-recorded videos. The Q&A parts will be held as online chat.


## Video Presentation

Authors should create a video recording of their presentation.

The video presentation should last
- **15 minutes** for long research papers, and 
- **10 minutes** for short research and demo papers.


To create a video, you can record your voice on top of the slides, and then export to a video.
For a more immersive experience, you may use a picture-in-picture capable video software to capture both the presenter and the slide content.

Here are some tools that you may use.

- PowerPoint: to record audio and export slide show to video. [Instructions](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/record-a-slide-show-with-narration-and-slide-timings-0b9502c6-5f6c-40ae-b1e7-e47d8741161c)

- Keynote: to record audio and export slide show to video. [Instructions](https://support.apple.com/guide/keynote/record-audio-tan8a5df9cc5/mac)

- Zoom: to record video and screen, with picture-in-picture functionality. [Instructions](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362473-Local-recording)

- [OBS](https://obsproject.com/): Free and open-source software for video and screen recording, with picture-in-picture functionality.


## Video and Slides Sharing

Authors should upload their video presentation to an online video service, such as YouTube, Vimeo, Dailymotion, or to a cloud storage service, such as Dropbox, Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive.

The video needs not be public, or listed. The only requirement is that the video is accessible via a *link*, private or public, and remain accessible at least until two weeks after the conference. This link will be shared with the conference participants.

Authors should also submit their slides in *PDF format*.

In an online questionnaire, authors will be asked to provide the video link, and upload their slides.

Deadline for filling out the questionnaire is **July 3**.



## Online Q&A

The interactive part of the conference will be facilitated via Slack. Participants can post questions and authors post answers in an asynchronous manner. There will a dedicated channel for each conference session.

Authors are required to participate in the discussion at the appropriate channel, particularly during the dates of **July 7--9**.
