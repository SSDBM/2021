# Social Events


<!-- **SSDBM 2020 will be an online event** with no physical meeting taking place.

All participants are invited to participate in the following social events. -->

### Welcome Reception

<!-- The welcome reception will be held on Tuesday evening in the [City Hall of Vienna](https://www.wien.gv.at/english/cityhall/).
It is located a few stops by underground from the conference venue (underground line U2, station "Rathaus").
Alternatively, it can be reached via a nice 30-minute walk along the [Ringstrasse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_Ring_Road) (flanked by many monumental
buildings such as the opera house, the Austrian parliament, some of the most prestigious museums, etc.).
