**Title:** Arrays in Databases: from Underdog to First-Class Citizen

**Abstract:** Array Databases close a gap in the database ecosystem by adding modelling, storage, and processing support for multi-dimensional arrays. Built into „datacubes“ such structures are known since long in OLAP and statistics, but they also appear as spatio-temporal sensor, image, simulation, and statistics data in all science and engineering domains. 

In our research we address Array Databases in all aspects, from concepts over architecture to applications. Our full-stack implementation rasdaman ("raster data manager"), which effectively has pioneered Array Databases, is in operational use on multi-Petabyte , federated Earth data assets. Based on this experience, the rasdaman team has initiated and shaped datacube standards such as ISO SQL/MDA (Multi-Dimensional Arrays) and the OGC Earth datacube standards suite.
In our talk we present concepts and implementation of rasdaman and show its application to Earth datacubes, illustrated by live demonstration of operational services.

**Bio:** Dr. Peter Baumann is Professor of Computer Science, inventor, and entrepreneur. At Jacobs University in Bremen, Germany he researches on flexible, scalable services on massive multi-dimensional datacubes and their application in science and engineering. He has published 160+ book chapters and journal and conference articles, holds international patents on array database technology, and has received numerous international innovation awards for his work. As Principal Architect of the rasdaman system, which is in operational use in planetary-scale datacube federations, he has pioneered the field of array databases and actionable datacubes. For its successful commercialization he has founded and leads the hitech spinoff, rasdaman GmbH. Further, he is active, often leading contributor to datacube standardization and editor of datacube standards in OGC and ISO, such as SQL/MDA, the SQL extension with Multi-Dimensional Arrays.
